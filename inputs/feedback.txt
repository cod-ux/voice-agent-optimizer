- Still did not hang up at the end
- Layer on additional discovery questions
  - What geographic locations are you looking for?
  - What are you looking for?
  - Revenue Range?
  - Personas you are targeting?
  - What geographic locations are you looking for?
- Would want to have AI use ZI data to personalize the questions
- How many questions should AI ask before the customer gets annoyed?
- Set the stage at the beginning of the call of what the AI is going to be asking (I want to learn about your process, ideal customers, etc.)
Transition the call from discovery to getting the meeting set “From what you’ve shared, I think it would be great to get you in touch with one of our AEs to discuss how Zoominfo can support your business needs”
