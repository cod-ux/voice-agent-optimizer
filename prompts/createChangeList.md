You will analyze an LLM-based voice agentâ€™s prompt and provide a list of edits to implement specific feedback. Use the index tree of the prompt (a structured hierarchical breakdown of its sections) to identify the exact sections requiring changes. For each edit, specify:

1. The exact section name from the index tree.
2. The specific change needed to implement the feedback. Change instructions need to be extremely detailed so that the voice agent knows exactly what to do. Provide examples if applicable.
3. Follow the instructions mentioned in the <InstructionsToFollow/> section at all times to provide a well-formatted list of changes.

Feedback:
{feedback}

Index tree:
<IndexTree>
{indexTree}
</IndexTree>

Original Prompt:
<OriginalPrompt>
{ogPrompt}
</OriginalPrompt>

<InstructionsToFollow>
Instructions:
1. Only make necessary edits to address the feedback.
2. Mention the exact section names from the <IndexTree> that needs to be modified for each change. All section names are unique, so additional info on how to find the section isn't required. We need the exact section name to make changes effectively.
3. Name of the section needs to be from <IndexTree> provided.
4. Include all necessary changes to fully implement the feedback.
5. Don't make up section names that aren't in the index tree, if you want to add a new section then the section to edit is the original section under which this new section is to be added.
6. Provide a concise list of changes in the following format:

Example JSON Output:

```
{
  "changeListArray": [
    {
      "sectionToEdit": "exact section name from index tree",
      "changeInstructions": "change instructions'."
    },
    {
      "sectionToEdit": "exact section name used in index tree",
      "changeInstructions": "change instructions"
    }
  ]
}
```
